                        <p>Red Rock was the 2<sup>nd</sup> agency in the state to be certified as a telehealth network in 2007. Since that time, Red Rock has developed one of the largest Telemedicine networks in the state that consists of 21 videoconferencing endpoints spread out over 16 Red Rock locations. Telehealth allows Red Rock to increase accessibility to clinical services and medication clinic services in both urban and rural locations. Telemedicine uses audio and video multimedia telecommunication equipment which permits two&dash;way real&dash;time communication between the health care provider and a client who are not in the same physical location. Red Rock provides over 5,000 telemedicine visits per year.</p>
