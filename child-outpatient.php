                <blockquote>&ldquo;Our greatest natural resource is the minds of our children&rdquo; <cite>&mdash;Walt Disney</cite></blockquote>
                    <p>The well&dash;being of a child&rsquo;s mind plays an integral part in their ability to succeed at school, home, work, and society. Children of Oklahoma are the future and how they think, feel and act will shape them as future leaders.</p>
                    <p>Red Rock &lpar;Planet Rock&rpar; utilizes evidenced&dash;based treatments that demonstrate exceptional outcomes. Our goal is that every child receiving services will successfully discharge upon resolving their issue&lpar;s&rpar; and live productive lives. Red Rock equips children with the ability to navigate their future using newly developed coping skills and having the knowledge to be their own therapist to overcome future challenges.</p>
                    <p>Oklahoma is ranked among one of the highest states of children who experience mental health and substance use disorders. Furthermore, Oklahoma has consistently demonstrated high &ldquo;Adverse Childhood Experiences&rdquo; &lpar;ACE&rpar; which are potentially traumatic events that can have negative and lasting effects on the child’s well&dash;being. Adverse Childhood experiences include economic hardship, divorce, separation, violence, assault, neighborhood violence, drugs&#47;alcohol, natural disasters, etc.</p>
                    <p>The &ldquo;State&rdquo; of Oklahoma statistics are unacceptable! We can help one Oklahoma child at a time by every child being a minding matter of the state.</p>

                                    <p>The Wraparound process is a way to improve the lives of children with complex needs and their families by developing individualized plans of care. The key characteristics of the process are that the plan is developed by a family centered team, is individualized based on the strengths and culture of the child and their family, and is driven by needs rather than services. In addition to addressing the needs of the identified youth, Wraparound plans are designed to meet the needs of caregivers and siblings and to address a range of life areas. <span>Most services are delivered in the family&rsquo;s home or community setting.</span> Through the team&dash;based planning and implementation process, Wraparound also aims to develop the problem&dash;solving skills, coping skills, and self&dash;efficacy of the young people and family members. Finally, there is an emphasis on integrating the youth into the community and building the family's social support network.</p>
