                    <p>Our priority at Planet Rock is to provide premier services to children and adolescents up to 17 years of age, focusing on cognitive, emotional and behavioral development within a trauma informed environment.</p>

                    <p>Planet Rock was developed with Oklahoma children in mind &dash; grounded in a philosophy that demonstrates we internalize our environment. The details of Planet Rock are significant and purposeful.</p>

                    <p>Planet Rock&rsquo;s curves and &ldquo;S&rdquo; shape upon entering the waiting room was by design. An &ldquo;S&rdquo; demonstrates a hint of the unexpected to something common &dash; which clearly demonstrates an analogy of life. The &ldquo;T&rdquo; at the end of the hall at Planet Rock demonstrates a life crossing, symbolizing health, hope and balance. The cloud shaped ceilings represent a mixture of elements, air, water, energy and earth. The clouds symbolize change; they come and go, move fast or slow and associated with higher thought, intellectual ideas and abstract thinking. The triangle room in Planet Rock, although developed for the purpose of conducting exercises in how we think, feel, and do, providing an opportunity to challenge our thoughts and develop healthier thinking habits, it also represents a shape that symbolizes stability, strength, and energy.</p>

                    <p class="colors">Colors of Planet Rock were carefully chosen to indicate how essential vegetation is to our survival, i.e., sweet corn, eggplant, wheat, tangerine and bees wax and simply being &ldquo;green&rdquo; or recycling. The colors of the lights include orange which depicts the energy of red and happiness of yellow. Orange increases oxygen to the brain and stimulates mental activity. Orange symbolizes strength and endurance. Green is the color of nature and is said to improve vision. It denotes lack of experience and has a universal meaning associated with free passage and go. Green symbolizes growth, harmony, and safety. Blue is considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows metabolism and produces a calming effect. There is an association with blue skies, water and sea related to cleanliness and symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, and intelligence. Purple combines the stability of blue and energy of red. Purple is associated with royalty and symbolizes mobility, splendor and ambition.</p>

                    <p>Although we offer numerous therapy modalities at Planet Rock, TF&dash;CBT &lpar;Trauma&dash;Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&rpar; is used extensively. TF&dash;CBT is a conjoint child and parent psychotherapy approach for children and adolescents who are experiencing significant emotional and behavioral difficulties associated with traumatic events. Therapy rooms were configured on the east side of the planet purposefully to accommodate the PRACTICE components involved in TF&dash;CBT.</p>

                    <p>Moving through the Planet from the front doors to the therapy rooms has purpose. Movement towards the East side of the building &lpar;to enter a therapy room&rpar; signifies viewing the past and present. Upon leaving and moving to the West &lpar;exiting&rpar; is symbolic of moving into the future, while walking on carpet appropriately named &dash; Motivation. The purpose demonstrates a metaphor of therapy &dash; we look at the problems from the past and present and develop the necessary skills to move beyond and move into the future.</p>

                    <p>Planet Rock is strategically located between Dream and Reality, nestled securely in the thought zone. Planet Rock cultivates brilliance and shapes effective futures. Planet Rock &dash; Where we live with purpose!</p>
