                <h3><label for="toggle1">What does it mean to have a mental illness?</label></h3>

                <p>Mental illnesses are medical conditions that disrupt a person&rsquo;s thinking, feeling, mood, ability to relate to others, and daily functioning. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illnesses are medical conditions that often result in a diminished capacity for coping with the ordinary demands of life.</p>

                <p>Some of the more common disorders are depression, bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. Symptoms may include changes in mood, personality, personal habits and/or social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances &lpar;SEDs&rpar;. Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, race, religion, or income.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some important facts about mental illness and recovery:</p>

                <p class="plist">Mental illnesses are biologically&dash;based brain disorders. They cannot be overcome through &ldquo;will power&rdquo; and are not related to a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;character&rdquo; or intelligence.</p>
                <p class="plist">It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 or 43.8 million adults in America. Mental disorders fall along a continuum of severity. Even though mental disorders are widespread in the population, the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion, nearly 10 million Americans, or 1 in 25 people suffer from a serious mental illness.</p>
                <p class="plist">Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood. All ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable.</p>
                <p class="plist">The best treatments for serious mental illnesses today are highly effective; between 70 and 90 percent of individuals have significant reduction of symptoms and improved quality of life with a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments and supports.</p>
                <p class="plist">With appropriate effective medication and a wide range of services tailored to their needs, most people who live with serious mental illnesses can significantly reduce the impact of their illness and find a satisfying measure of achievement and independence. A key concept is to develop expertise in developing strategies to manage the illness process.</p>
                <p class="plist">Early identification and treatment is of vital importance. By ensuring access to the treatment and recovery supports that are proven effective, recovery is accelerated and the further harm related to the course of illness is minimized.</p>

                <h3><label for="toggle2">What does it mean to have a Substance Use Disorder?</label></h3>

                <p>Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. According to the DSM&dash;5, a diagnosis of substance use disorder is based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological criteria.

                <p>Excessive alcohol use can increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing serious health problems in addition to those issues associated with intoxication behaviors and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lpar;CDC&rpar;, excessive alcohol use causes 88,000 deaths a year.</p>
                <p>To be diagnosed with an AUD, individuals must meet certain diagnostic criteria. Some of these criteria include problems controlling intake of alcohol, continued use of alcohol despite problems resulting from drinking, development of a tolerance, drinking that leads to risky situations, or the development of withdrawal symptoms. The severity of an AUD &dash; mild, moderate, or severe &dash; is based on the number of criteria met.</p>

                <p>According to the CDC, more than 480,000 deaths each year are caused by cigarette smoking. Tobacco use and smoking do damage to nearly every organ in the human body, often leading to lung cancer, respiratory disorders, heart disease, stroke, and other illnesses.</p>

                <p>In 2014, an estimated 66.9 million Americans aged 12 or older were current users of a tobacco product &lpar;25.2&#37;&rpar;. Young adults aged 18 to 25 had the highest rate of current use of a tobacco product &lpar;35&#37;&rpar;, followed by adults aged 26 or older &lpar;25.8&#37;&rpar;, and by youths aged 12 to 17 &lpar;7&#37;&rpar;.</p>

                <p>In 2014, the prevalence of current use of a tobacco product was 37.8&#37; for American Indians or Alaska Natives, 27.6&#37; for whites, 26.6&#37; for blacks, 30.6&#37; for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, 18.8&#37; for Hispanics, and 10.2&#37; for Asians.</p>

                <h3><label for="toggle5">What does it mean to have a Opioid Use Disorder?</label></h3>

                <p>Opioids reduce the perception of pain but can also produce drowsiness, mental confusion, euphoria, nausea, constipation, and, depending upon the amount of drug taken, can depress respiration. Illegal opioid drugs, such as heroin and legally available pain relievers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone can cause serious health effects in those who misuse them. Some people experience a euphoric response to opioid medications, and it is common that people misusing opioids try to intensify their experience by snorting or injecting them. These methods increase their risk for serious medical complications, including overdose. Other users have switched from prescription opiates to heroin as a result of availability and lower price. Because of variable purity and other chemicals and drugs mixed with heroin on the black market, this also increases risk of overdose. Overdoses with opioid pharmaceuticals led to almost 17,000 deaths in 2011. Since 1999, opiate overdose deaths have increased 265&#37; among men and 400&#37; among women.</p>

                <p>In 2014, an estimated 1.9 million people had an opioid use disorder related to prescription pain relievers and an estimated 586,000 had an opioid use disorder related to heroin use.</p>

                <p>Symptoms of opioid use disorders include strong desire for opioids, inability to control or reduce use, continued use despite interference with major obligations or social functioning, use of larger amounts over time, development of tolerance, spending a great deal of time to obtain and use opioids, and withdrawal symptoms that occur after stopping or reducing use, such as negative mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, diarrhea, fever, and insomnia.

                <p>Marijuana is the most&dash;used drug after alcohol and tobacco in the United States. According to SAMHSA data:</p>

                <p class="plist">In 2014, about 22.2 million people ages 12 and up reported using marijuana during the past month.</p>

                <p class="plist">Also in 2014, there were 2.6 million people in that age range who had used marijuana for the first time within the past 12 months. People between the ages of 12 and 49 report first using the drug at an average age of 18.5.</p>

                <p>In the past year, 4.2 million people ages 12 and up met criteria for a substance use disorder based on marijuana use. Marijuana&rsquo;s immediate effects include distorted perception, difficulty with thinking and problem solving, and loss of motor coordination. Long&dash;term use of the drug can contribute to respiratory infection, impaired memory, and exposure to cancer&dash;causing compounds. Heavy marijuana use in youth has also been linked to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221171/" target="_blank">increased risk for developing mental illness and poorer cognitive functioning</a>.</p>

                <p>Some symptoms of cannabis use disorder include disruptions in functioning due to cannabis use, the development of tolerance, cravings for cannabis, and the development of withdrawal symptoms, such as the inability to sleep, restlessness, nervousness, anger, or depression within a week of ceasing heavy use.</p>

                <h3><label for="toggle13">Is a parent/guardian/care taker required to attend a child’s therapy?</label></h3>

                <p>Parents/guardians are encouraged to be involved with their child&rsquo;s therapy. During the screening and assessment process, it is essential that the parent be present to help the therapist learn about the child&rsquo;s history related to educational, behavioral, emotional health. Therapy is a private process and for your child to benefit from therapy a confidential relationship must exist between the child and therapist. The therapist will not be able to tell parents what goes on during the session. That does not mean that the parent will not be involved. A regular meeting with the parent and therapist is beneficial to help the parent learn techniques to help support the therapy session. The therapist will make sure that your child understands that the meeting between you and the therapist is not to discuss what goes on in session. It is to help the parent learn how to support them to recover. </p>

                <p>Some therapies do require that the parent/guardian is involved in every session. Parent&dash;Child&dash;Interaction Therapy &lpar;PCIT&rpar; is one of those therapies. It is a therapy for parents and children under the age of 8. Parents are required to attend every session because parents are learning how to support their child through coaching sessions with the therapist.</p>

                <p>Parents should discuss with the therapist during the first appointments how involved they should be in the therapy process.
