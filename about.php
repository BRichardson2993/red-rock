                            <h2>2008&dash;2010</h2>
                            <p>Red Rock was one of the first CMHC in the state to start Telemedicine Medication Clinics and to become an OHCA Approved Network site. Through telemedicine services Red Rock was able to improve access to mental health consumers in areas that are underserved and without psychiatric services. By working with Oklahoma State University medical school in Tulsa they provided Red Rock with the equipment to begin this vital service. The first clinic was provided to Shawnee Red Rock with the psychiatrist at the distant site located in the Oklahoma City office. Red Rock has continued to expand this service to meet the needs of their consumers who are located in rural areas. They currently provide Telemedicine services out of the Norman Crisis Unit to locations in Elk City, Clinton, Watonga, Canadian County and Shawnee. Because of this service more consumers are able to see their psychiatrist on a regular basis to oversee their psychiatric needs. The overall consensus and reception from the consumers have been very positive.
                            </p>

                            <h2>2004&dash;2007</h2> In 2004 Oklahoma City opens a Children&rsquo;s Crisis Unit
                            <p>On November 1st, 2006, Red Rock opened a 26 bed Crisis Stabilization Unit in Norman on the grounds of Griffin Memorial Hospital with the purpose to serve the Crisis needs of eleven counties south of the metropolitan area of Oklahoma City and to reduce the census of Griffin Memorial Hospital of short term treatment consumers so they could serve the long term treatment needs of the State. Because of the success of the unit, Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services ask Red Rock to expand that unit with 30 additional beds to further meet the front door needs of consumers in Crisis. So, on September 21st, 2009, Red Rock opened its second unit on the grounds of Griffin Memorial Hospital which gives them a total of 56 Crisis Beds to serve the Central Region of the State. This gives the Central Region of the State more crisis beds available for consumers and makes Red Rock one of the largest Crisis Units in the State of Oklahoma.
